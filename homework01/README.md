Contains the first homework for COE332, consisting of three total exercises. The first exercise (exercise1.py) prints the five longest words in the file "words". The second exercise (exercise2.py) prints out five total full names that are exactly eight characters in length. The third exercise (exercise3.py) stores five random full names in a list, determines the length of each name, and prints out each name with its respective length.

**Note to compile and run each exercise: <br />
-exercise1.py requires the file "words" to be in the repo /usr/share/dict <br />
-exercise2.py & exercise 3.py needs names library to be imported, via the code: pip3 install --user names
