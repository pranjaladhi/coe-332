# Robot Site Investigation

## Purpose
One of the goals of this project is to determine the time it takes a robot to investigate five different meteorite landing sites in the Syrtis Major on Mars. First, the coordinates and meteorite composition found in each site will be randomly generated. Taking that data of the sites, the time it takes for a robot to travel to each of the five sites will be calculated. Lastly, the total time for the robot to finish all five site investigations will be calculated, to determine the efficiency of the robot on Mars. Going through this project and writing the code, the main objective is to learn how to work with the JSON data format, while learning the application it has with Python. It is important to learn JSON as it is a powerful and flexible data format applicable in the technological industry, especially in web applications. Thus, fimiliarizing and working with JSON will allow for the understanding the capability of JSON in large data formats.
